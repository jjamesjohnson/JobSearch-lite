Search and scraping agents for Job Findr Agent.

- Targeted search query generation for better results
- Job posting extraction and normalization

# decides. The tool must follow the provider: ADK's google_search grounding only
# works with Gemini models (resolve_model returns a raw string for Gemini and a
# LiteLlm wrapper for everything else), so non-Gemini backends use the Tavily
# tool instead (which requires TAVILY_API_KEY).
